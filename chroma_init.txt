# RCM Data Structure and Chroma DB Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the data structure of the Risk Control Matrix (RCM) output generated by the `generate_standard.py` script. It also provides guidance for implementing a Chroma DB solution to enable efficient querying and analysis of the RCM data.

## Data Structure

The `rcm_output.json` file contains an array of RCM objects, each representing a specific business process. The structure is as follows:

### Key Components

1. **Process**: The top-level object representing a business process.
2. **Standard**: Regulatory frameworks or industry standards applicable to the process.
3. **Requirement**: Specific requirements within each standard.
4. **Control**: Measures implemented to address risks and meet standard requirements.
5. **Risk**: Potential issues that could impact the business process.

## Implementing Chroma DB

To implement Chroma DB for efficient querying and analysis of the RCM data:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Parse the JSON file and extract relevant information for each component (Process, Standard, Requirement, Control, Risk).
   - Create unique identifiers for each component if not already present.

2. **Embedding Generation**:
   - Generate embeddings for textual data (names and descriptions) using a suitable embedding model.

3. **Chroma DB Setup**:
   - Create separate collections for each component type (Processes, Standards, Requirements, Controls, Risks).
   - Insert the data into appropriate collections, including the generated embeddings.

4. **Metadata and Relationships**:
   - Include metadata for each document to maintain relationships between components (e.g., control_id for risks, standard_id for controls).

5. **Querying**:
   - Implement query functions to search across collections based on text similarity or metadata filters.

6. **Integration**:
   - Develop an API or interface to interact with the Chroma DB, allowing for complex queries and data retrieval.

## Example Queries

1. Find all controls related to a specific standard.
2. Retrieve risks associated with a particular process.
3. Search for requirements containing specific keywords across all standards.
4. Identify controls that address multiple risks.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the Chroma DB solution using the provided data structure.
2. Develop query functions to support common use cases.
3. Create a user interface for easy interaction with the RCM data.
4. Implement regular updates to keep the database in sync with any changes to the RCM data.
